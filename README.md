# Satellite Catastrophe Database
## Overview
 This database includes initial condition data for catastrophe research. Initial conditions can be propagated to model debris clouds following catastrophic failure. This database is for research purposes only currently; members of the ERAU STAR Labs team may access this data. The goal of the project is to develop data and tools regarding debris propagation that may be used to develop space policy.

## How to use this database
 Data is stored in .mat files - use MATLAB to see the contents. Each file contains initial states to propagate. Apply an explosion model (NASA Standard) to the initial conditions and propagate using CR3BP.
